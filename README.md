# Introduction
The SipRecClient class library is a .NET DLL that Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1) applications can use to record multimedia NG9-1-1 calls. Applications that use the [SipLib](https://github.com/PhrSite/SipLib) and the [Ng911Lib](https://github.com/PhrSite/Ng911Lib) class libraries can use this class library. The following block diagram shows the relationship between the SipRecClient class library, the NG9-1-1 application, SIP Recording Server(s) (SRS) and NG9-1-1 Log Event Servers.
